Simple Syntax
The syntax is similar to the one you used with str.format() but less verbose. Look at how easily readable this is:

>>> age = 74
>>> f"Hello, {name}. You are {age}."
'Hello, Eric. You are 74.'

It would also be valid to use a capital letter F:
>>> F"Hello, {name}. You are {age}."
'Hello, Eric. You are 74.'

You could do something pretty straightforward, like this:
>>> f"{2 * 37}"
'74'
